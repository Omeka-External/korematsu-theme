## Installation

For basic out-of-the-box use of the theme, follow the [Omeka S User Manual instructions for installing themes](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/sites/site_theme/#installing-themes).

For more advanced use, such as customizing the theme with Sass, you'll need to install the tools with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater). Navigate to your theme directory and run `npm install`.

## Theme Features

- Page with Hero (a page with the hero slider set in the theme's settings page)
- Page with Hero - No page navigation (same as the above but without page navigation)
- Full width (a page with full width layout)

### Assets with animated captions

You can add assets whose captions show up with a transition effect over the asset when you hover them.

To do this, you just have to add a "Group" block to your page, then assign a class "image-hover-text" to this block, and finally add 3 blocks to the Group:
1. Asset block: The image.
2. HTML block: The content that will show up in the animated caption on hover the image. It must have an <h4> heading in order for it to be previewed over the image.
3. HTML block: Another HTML block just to add the link. It will be rendered as an arrow button.

### Colored Captions

Captions in blocks like "Asset", "Item Carousel", and "Media Embed" are rendered with a color background (blue by default).

You can customize this color (beige or red) by assigning either "caption-beige" or "caption-red" class to the block in the "Block layout configuration" panel.

### Group blocks with color background

You can add Group blocks and assign some specific classes in order for them to have a solid color background:
- `has-background`: Class to assign the group block a solid color background.
- `<color>`: The solid color to assign to the background. It can be `blue`, `red` or `beige`. If no color class is assigned, it'll default to `blue`.

Optionally, you can add the `fullwidth` class to make it look full width (within the theme default container).

**Note:** By default, Omeka S offers a "Background" setting in the "Block layout configuration" panel where you can assign a custom color (3- or 6-digit hexadecimal color). However, we recommend using the color classes mentioned above in order to preserve this theme's look&feel. 

## Customizing the Theme

If you want to customize the site with your own CSS, the [CSS Editor](https://omeka.org/s/modules/CSSEditor/) module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, this theme includes variables and mixins for managing and extending many styles.

### Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

* **npm run start**: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
* **gulp css**: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.
* **gulp css:watch**: This task watches for changes in the Sass, then compiles the CSS.

## Utility classes
Korematsu S offers a set of predefined utility classes that will help you to add styles to certain elements by just assigning them these classes.

You can even combine multiple utility classes.

- `inline`
- `alignleft`
- `alignright`
- `aligncenter`
- `alignfull`
- `alignwide`
- `alignnarrow`
- `textleft`
- `textright`
