## Customizing the Theme

If you want to customize the site with your own CSS, the [CSS Editor](https://omeka.org/s/modules/CSSEditor/) module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, this theme includes variables and mixins for managing and extending many styles.

### Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

* **npm run start**: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
* **gulp css**: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.
* **gulp css:watch**: This task watches for changes in the Sass, then compiles the CSS.
